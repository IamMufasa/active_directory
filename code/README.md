# This code is designed to automate the creation of domain users for Windows Active Directory

The `gen_ad.ps1` script can be used in combination with a JSON file to generate domain users and groups.

The `ad_schema.json` file offers an example of how the JSON files are structured. 

The `random_users.ps1` script can be used with data pulled from active_directory\data to randomize the creation of domain users.
